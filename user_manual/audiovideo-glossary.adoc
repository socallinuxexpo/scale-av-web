= Audio/Video Glossary

Here are some terms you might read or hear during the weekend.

*Amplifier*: a device that produces a gain in signal level

*Balanced Audio*: An audio signal transmission strategy which sends an inverted copy with the original signal to allow devices to use the two copies to remove common noise common to both signals.

*Bandwidth*: The range of frequencies a signal occupies.

*Compressor*: A device which reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal.

*Countryman*: A brand of headset, earset, and lavalier microphones

*DI Box*: Also called a Direct box.
It is said to stand for Direct Injection or Direct Input.
Converts an unbalanced high impedance signal to a balanced low impedance signal.

*Dynamic Range*: The difference between the largest and smallest values a quantity can assume, such as volume.

*Ground Lift*: A switch on some audio devices that disconnects the cable shield.
Used in attempts to stop hum induced by ground loops.

*Ground Loop*: Sometimes when connecting audio equipment to each other, a potential between the two devices`' grounds can occur which induces current flow at a frequency of the mains line voltage (60Hz in the US).
This produces an unwanted audible hum in the signal.

*Impedance*: Measured in Ohms, it is the AC equivalent of resistance and represents opposition to current flow in a circuit.

*Lavalier*: A type of small microphone often clipped to a tie or garment.

*Line Level*: A signal with a higher voltage than Mic Level and is used between various audio devices before being sent to the amplifier.

*Mic Level*: A signal with a relatively low voltage.

*Speaker Level:* The highest voltage signal of the Mic, Instrument, Line, Speaker levels that has been amplified and can be sent to a passive loudspeaker.

*TS*: Tip-Sleeve phone audio connector.
Used for an unbalanced mono signal.

*TRS*: Tip-Ring-Sleeve phone audio connector.
Can be used as for an unbalanced stereo or balanced mono signal.

*XLR*: A balanced audio connector with three conductors used for connecting microphones and other audio equipment.
Its balanced nature makes it ideal for longer cable runs.

*Z*: An abbreviation for electrical impedance.
