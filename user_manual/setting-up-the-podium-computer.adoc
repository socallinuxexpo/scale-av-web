. When connecting cables, you want to end with a clean and tidy set of cables running not in the way of the speaker and not a rats nest.
Do not allow wires to dangle.
. Connect one of the Ethernet cables coming from the network switch into the **Ethernet**jack.The other cable is for Speaker Laptop use.If you need to connect the cables to the switches, confirm which ports are designated foryouto use.

. Connect the VGA plug of the Speaker's Laptop VGA/Audio cable to the *VGA In* jack.
. Connect the VGA cable going to the projector to the *VGA Out* jack.
. Connect the KVM Source Switch to the *Switch* jack by pushing in the connector.
Do not screw the connector in.
. Plug the AC side of the *AC adapter* power cord into a power outlet of the surge proctor inside or near the podium, but do not connect the DC side to the computer yet, this is because the computer may automatically turn on when power is connected.
. When ready, connect the IEC cable to the AC Adapter IEC socket and connect the DC barrel plug to the *12V DC Power Connection* barrel jack.
. Alert the NOC that the computer is connected and if instructed, press the *Power Switch* to power on the machine.
