=== Podium Computer ===

image::./assets/podium-computer-front-panel-connections.png[]

* [ ] Place the computer on the shelf of the speaker’s podium.

* [ ] When connecting cables, you want to end with a clean and tidy set of
cables running that are not in the way of the speaker and not a rats nest. 
Do not allow wires to dangle.

* [ ] Connect the Ethernet cable labeled “AV” coming from the network
switch into the PC Ethernet jack. The other Ethernet cable labeled “Speaker” is
for Presenter's Laptop use. If the Ethernet cables are not already plugged into
the network switch, you will need to connect the cables to the switches.
Use an empty port in the AV VLAN range (22-27, confirm with diagram posted on Switch)

* [ ] Connect the HDMI plug (using the side without the adapters) of the
Speaker’s Laptop HDMI/VGA/Audio cable to the HDMI In jack.

* [ ] Connect the HDMI cable going to the projector to the HDMI Out jack.

* [ ] Connect the KVM Source Switch to the Switch jack in the upper right by
pushing in the connector. Do not screw the connector in.

* [ ] Plug the AC adapter power cord into a power outlet of the
surge protector inside or near the podium.

* [ ] Connect the AC Adapter to the Podium Computer.

* [ ] Alert the NOC that the computer is connected and if instructed, press the
Power Switch to power on the machine. The machine will turn on and the power button
will light up green. If the computer does not come on, wait 45 seconds, watching the
LCD screen on the front panel to see if penguins display on the screen.

* [ ] Confirm that the Podium Computer has a good network connection by looking
at the inner motherboard through the clear right side wall of the computer.
You should see both a solid blue Link light and a flashing orange Activity light from the right.

 TIP: The light is located roughly underneath the penguin logo etched on top of the box.

* [ ] Test the KVM Video Switch by pressing the pushbutton on the KVM remote.
Each time you press the remote, one of two lights near the bottom
of the front of the computer will turn on, indicating which source is active.

* [ ] Tape the Laminated Speaker Reminder Flyer to the top of the podium.

* [ ] Tape the KVM switch about 6 inches from the bottom edge of the podium
towards the left edge of the top of the podium.

* [ ] Tape down the *HDMI Adapters Cable Set*, leaving enough slack in the cable
on the side with the adapters so that the presenter can comfortably plug the
adapters into their laptop.

=== Room Testing Procedures ===

This procedure can be run by just a volunteer with a year or more
experience. New volunteers should pair with more experienced volunteers.When in
doubt, ask an A/V expert for help. “Easily audible” means loud enough to hear
in a room full of people, but not so loud that it is painful or distorted.
“Elevated enough” means as high as it can go and still be stable. Typically
this is high enough to look over standing audience members (approximately 8
feet). Please do not adjust audio settings without AV NOC approval.

* [ ] Test the in-room audio levels. Audio should be noise-free and clear in
all areas of the room and easily audible. Have your setup partner stand near
the loudspeaker and then later in the back of the room to confirm that you are
audible. When testing a microphone, hold the microphone near your mouth and
talk at a normal level, letting the microphone do the amplification of the
voice. Count to ten to ensure that your partner has enough sample audio to
listen to for each test. Check the audio levels of the following devices:

** [ ] Earset microphone (also called lavelier/lav)

** [ ] Handheld microphones #1 and #2 (if present)

** [ ] Laptop audio feed by plugging in a 3.5mm test source such as a 
phone or laptop into the audio cable already at the podium. 
Avoid playing copyrighted sounds when testing, such as music. 
If you have a phone, record your voice and play it back.

** [ ] (If present) Panel microphones

* [ ] Request attention from the Monitoring Computer operator.

* [ ] With consultation from the Monitoring Computer operator, check that the camera has been set up properly:

** [ ] Camera should have a clear view of the podium

** [ ] Camera should be elevated enough to see over audience

** [ ] Camera feed should be clean

** [ ] Camera should not wobble on the stand. If using a Samsung Camera, the Camera mount should extend over a leg for stability.

* [ ] Help the Monitoring Computer operator check the recorded audio levels. For each item in Step 1 above, ensure that the monitoring computers pick up clear audio on the audio channel of the monitoring feed.

* [ ] Ensure that no other noise or interference is in the room. Report if there is something unusual about a room that might affect audio quality, such as flickering lights, loud fans, hum/buzz, etc.

Done! If issues were detected, please notify A/V NOC.
