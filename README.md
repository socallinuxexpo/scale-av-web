============

SCALE A/V is the team that handles A/V for the [Southern California Linux Expo](http://socallinuxexpo.org), an open source conference.  We consist of volunteers.  We are currently working on SCALE 12x, which will be on Feb 21-23, 2014 at the LAX Hilton.

There are many [volunteer opportunities](https://github.com/scale-av/scale-av-web/wiki/Volunteer-opportunities) before and during the conference.  If you are interested in volunteering, please make sure you sign up for the [scale-av mailing list](https://lists.linuxfests.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/scale-av).  That is where A/V-related discussions occur and where announcements will be made.  Please also bookmark this page.  We will be posting more information as we figure out logistical and technical issues.
